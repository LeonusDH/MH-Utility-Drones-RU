# Description
Android Tiers Utility Drones is a related mod to Android Tiers Reforged to bring a new set of mechanical pawns into the colony for utilitarian purposes.

Highly specialized drones that excel at particular tasks - what they lack in generalization they make up for in capability.

## Features
* Introduction of utility drones to RimWorld, using Mechanical Humanlike's framework.
* An astonishing lack of art assets!
* The Grunt, a workhorse drone specialized in dealing with unskilled labor.
* The Envoy, a fragile drone capable of social skills and excellent versatility, but unable to do most labor tasks.
* The Overseer, a hyperspecialized drone capable of mechanic and research work, but almost nothing else.
* Two scenarios utilizing the new races (one requiring Military Tiers) that will prove very difficult. Can a drone hive survive alone, or will sapients take command?

## Known Issues/Incompatibilities
* Unknown

## Contributions
* Thermo: Thumbnail/Preview
* Indonesian Gentleman(Discord)/Greensniperhat(Steam): ATM Pawn graphics (which are being used as placeholders here)!
